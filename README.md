# Anime-WebApp

A Blazor WASM Web Application for Anime enthusiasts. Made for the sole purpose of practicing Blazor WASM and ASP.NET.

This web app consumes two separate APIs. The famous JikanApi to search the MyAnimeList database, as well as AniApi for streaming purposes.

#Takeaways 

The main takes from this project is the practice of using the Repository Pattern, getting hands on with JS Interop, 
the new Json serializer and Http requests formatter, the IHttpClientFactory, and many more great ASP.NET core concepts.
