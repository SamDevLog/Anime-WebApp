## Anime Cavern

This is a Blazor WASM Web Application for Anime enthusiasts. Made for the sole purposes of learning and practicing Blazor WASM and ASP.NET Core.
This web app consumes two separate APIs without the use of any wrappers. The famous Jikan Api was used to search the MyAnimeList database, as well as AniApi for streaming anime episodes and movies.

## Takeaways 

The main takes from this project is the practice of using the Repository Pattern, getting hands on with JS Interop, 
the new Json serializer and Http requests formatter inside the HttpClientExtensions class, the IHttpClientFactory interface, and many more great ASP.NET core concepts.
Not to forget the ever exciting world of CSS as is evident in the repo stats.
